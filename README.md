# SYMPHONY

Symphony is an interactive music experience that utilizes computer vision technology to detect leg gestures made by the participant using ArucoMarkers. 
The project utilizes the OpenCV library and ArucoMarkers to detect specific markers placed on the floor, and through the use of boolean expressions in conditional statements, produces corresponding musical notes or sounds. 
This project also incorporates the Tkinter library to provide a user-friendly interface for the participant, making the experience more engaging and interactive. 
Written in Python, Symphony utilizes various other libraries such as NumPy, threading, time, OS, Tkinter and PyGame to facilitate image processing, threading, and sound output for a seamless and exciting experience.
